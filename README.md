# Minimal ReactJS demo

Minimal reactjs demo for learning purposes, how reactjs code is compiled and served to browsers.

## How to run it?

**You don't need to download nodejs because result file is already present, however you may want to do this if you want to play around with existing code and change it**

**Make sure you have nodejs installed - [nodejs download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**

`node under-reactjs-skirt.js`

This will compile the file and create new `under-reactjs-skirt-result.js` file.
